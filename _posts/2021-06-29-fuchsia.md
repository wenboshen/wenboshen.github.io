## Memory Management

Kernel page table is:
[`arm64_kernel_translation_table`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.cc;l=78)

User page table for a process is:
[`ArmArchVmAspace->tt_phys_`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/arch/arm64/include/arch/aspace.h;l=152)

The page table allocation is in [`ArmArchVmAspace->Init`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.cc;l=1589).


The context switch code is:
[`ContextSwitch`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.cc;l=1656) where the `tt_phys_` value is written to the `ttbr0_el1`.


## Process Create
Zircon provides [`zx_process_create`](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls/process_create) syscall, which is implemented in
[`sys_process_create`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/lib/syscalls/task.cc;l=207), which calls

[`ProcessDispatcher::Create`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/object/process_dispatcher.cc;l=64), which calls

[`VmAspace::Create`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/object/process_dispatcher.cc;l=163), which calls

[`VmAspace::Init`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/object/process_dispatcher.cc;l=125), which calls

[`ArmArchVmAspace->Init`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f4:zircon/kernel/arch/arm64/mmu.cc;l=1589) to setup page tables.

## Zircon Handles
[Zircon Handles](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/handles) allows user space programs to reference kernel objects.

* Sharable Resource: 
Zircon maintains a global struct call [`HandleTableArena gHandleTableArena`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/object/handle.cc;l=76) for allocating all Handles.

* Limit:
The arena has a limit for all live handles, specified by [`kMaxHandleCount`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/object/handle.cc;l=18), whose value is 256 * 1024.
`gHandleTableArena` contains a member of [`fbl::GPArena<Handle::PreserveSize, sizeof(Handle)> arena_`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/object/include/object/handle.h;l=154), whose [`Init`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/lib/fbl/include/fbl/gparena.h;l=42) allocates [`kMaxHandleCount * handle_size`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/object/handle.cc;l=78) memory. If the number of live handles goes beyond the limit, `Alloc` will [return nullptr](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/lib/fbl/include/fbl/gparena.h;l=121).

* Abstract Resource Attack:
The attacker can consume handles to exhaust all handles in gHandleTableArena. 1) Handles are frequently-used in Zircon. Any events, processes, or threads are consuming new handles. 2) Currently we did not find any per-user limits on handles. 3) If handles are exhausted, the users cannot send events or creates any processes or threads.

* Count:
GPArena maintains a `count_`, which increments in [`Alloc`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/lib/fbl/include/fbl/gparena.h;l=126).

## Zircon Rights
Zircon supports 21 rights [list](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/rights).

The right data structure `zx_rights_t` is defined in zircon/system/public/zircon/rights.h as a uint32_t. The code is `typedef uint32_t zx_rights_t`.

For rights, the basic check function is the [`handle->HasRights`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f5:zircon/kernel/object/include/object/handle.h;l=58). Such as in system calls [`zx_handle_duplicate`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f5:zircon/kernel/lib/syscalls/handle_ops.cc;l=76), the basic check is used in [`handle_dup_replace`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f5:zircon/kernel/lib/syscalls/handle_ops.cc;l=55).

The right checking has wrappers, such as [`GetDispatcherWithRights`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f5:zircon/kernel/object/include/object/handle_table.h;l=106;drc=0f821e5b7178e9fdd7f445a7211d57fd0e814d0f), which in turn calls [`HasRights`](https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/releases/f5:zircon/kernel/object/include/object/handle_table.h;l=241;drc=0f821e5b7178e9fdd7f445a7211d57fd0e814d0f).




## Zircon Syscalls
Zircon supports about 150 system calls [full list](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/reference/syscalls).

The system calls will list the rights it required.
