Dr. Wenbo Shen is a ZJU100 Young Professor at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). 
His research interests are operating system security, container security, and software supply chain security. He has published over 50 research papers at top-tier academic conferences. Dr. Wenbo Shen is a recipient of four distinguished paper awards ([ESORICS 24](https://esorics2024.org/accepted_papers-en), [ACSAC 22](https://www.acsac.org/archive/), [AsiaCCS 17](https://asiaccs2017.trust-sysec.com/program/distinguished-papers/),  [NDSS 16](https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2016/02/ndss-2016-grants-distinguished-papers-awards/)). His research work on [Real-time Kernel Protection (RKP)](https://docs.samsungknox.com/admin/fundamentals/whitepaper/core-platform-security/real-time-kernel-protection/) has been deployed on hundreds of millions of devices.

Research
======
Dr. Wenbo Shen and his team concentrate on two primary areas. [[Full paper list](/publications)]
- **Operating System Kernel Security**: 1) performing **OS kernel analysis** to discover and eliminate new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities; 2) utilizing current hardware capabilities to develop innovative **software-based protection strategies** for the kernel; 3) leveraging software-hardware co-design to create **new hardware features** for system and software security.
